Suppose you have a screenshot of a Twitter post. You can get the link to the original post - for instance, by using <a href="https://github.com/NotCompsky/utils/blob/master/bash/find-tweet">find-tweet</a>. You can then go to that file, click "Update src", and change the source to the Twitter post's URL. This will keep the screenshot as a 'backup' of the post.

Suppose you wish to record some snippets of C++ code. You can open the text editor, paste the code into the main content section, name the file, tag it 'C++', then select a remote directory. ANY remote directory can be used, however I would suggest creating a 'directory' named "Code Snippets" - specifically ommitting the protocol and other unnecessary parts - specifically for code snippets like these. When this 'file' is saved, it creates a record in the database, with the contents as the 'file' description - no content is written to an <i>actual</i> file aside from the database.
