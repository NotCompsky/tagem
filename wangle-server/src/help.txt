USAGE
	[[OPTIONS]] p [PORT_NUMBER] c [THUMBNAIL_DIRECTORY] [[EXTERNAL_DATABASES]]

OPTIONS
	Y [youtube-dl format]
		DEFAULT
			The default value restricts downloads to [height<=720] and prioritises the most compressed formats.
		EXAMPLES
			See https://github.com/TheFrenchGhosty/TheFrenchGhostys-YouTube-DL-Archivist-Scripts
	d [PATH]
		Path to a script that takes an URL argument and prints (to stdout) a JSON array of elements, where each element is an array with the same format as those returned by the server in directory views.
		At the time of writing, the format of each element would be:
			[THUMBNAIL_SRC, DIRECTORY_ID, FILE_NAME, FILE_SIZE, "", "", "", ""]
		This is meant for viewing remote directories.
	^ [/PATH/TO/extract-yt-era]
		Path to a script that tags (url, begin, end, outpath) as arguments, and downloads a file - using youtube-dl - to extract exactly that portion of the video at [url], and save it to [outpath].

EXTERNAL DATABASES
	Optional
	List of environmental variables, each preceded by "x", pointing to files of the same format as $TAGEM_MYSQL_CFG, containing login data for foreign databases
	Eg
		x REDDIT_MYSQL_CFG x TWITTER_MYSQL_CFG
	These foreign databases should contain, at a minimum, a "post" table
	Each database should be of a unique name.
	The tagem database itself contains the "post2file" table, which maps the external database's posts to tagem's files
		// The alternative - the external database containing this table - would involve a lot more database calls. With this system, we can do a simple join, to tell clients that which posts are available in which external databases, and then only access the external database from file info and advanced queries.
	Other obtional tables, that will be recognised and used if available, are:
		"user" for users
		"user2tagem_tag" linking the user to tagem's tag table
		"follow" linking users to other users
		"post2mention" and "post2like" linking users to posts
		"cmnt" for comments
		"cmnt2mention" and "cmnt2like" linking users to comments
		"hashtag2tagem_tag" linking tagem's tag table to the foreign hashtags
		"hashtag"
		"post2hashtag" linking posts to hashtags
		"follow_hashtag" linking users to hashtags

VIEW_REMOTE_DIR_SHELL_COMMANDS
	Optional
	List of executables, each preceded by :, that clients are allowed to execute, with clients supplying one argument to that executable.
	EXAMPLES
		: ../remote-dir-viewers/imgur-gallery.py : /usr/bin/view-tumblr-gallery
