OPTIONS
	X /path/to/file
		Write external commands to this file
		Hint: If these are BASH commands, could execute these lines as they are written:
			mkfifo /tmp/tagem-external-cmds.pipe
			(./server X /tmp/tagem-external-cmds.txt ...)&
			while read line; do  eval "$line";  done < /tmp/tagem-external-cmds.pipe
		Obviously security concerns etc.

EXTERNAL DATABASES
	Optional
	List of environmental variables, each preceded by "x", pointing to files of the same format as $TAGEM_MYSQL_CFG, containing login data for foreign databases
	Eg
		x REDDIT_MYSQL_CFG x TWITTER_MYSQL_CFG
	These foreign databases should contain, at a minimum, a "post" table
	Each database should be of a unique name.
	The tagem database itself contains the "post2file" table, which maps the external database's posts to tagem's files
		// The alternative - the external database containing this table - would involve a lot more database calls. With this system, we can do a simple join, to tell clients that which posts are available in which external databases, and then only access the external database from file info and advanced queries.
	Other obtional tables, that will be recognised and used if available, are:
		"user" for users
		"user2tagem_tag" linking the user to tagem's tag table
		"follow" linking users to other users
		"post2mention" and "post2like" linking users to posts
		"cmnt" for comments
		"cmnt2mention" and "cmnt2like" linking users to comments
		"hashtag2tagem_tag" linking tagem's tag table to the foreign hashtags
		"hashtag"
		"post2hashtag" linking posts to hashtags
		"follow_hashtag" linking users to hashtags
