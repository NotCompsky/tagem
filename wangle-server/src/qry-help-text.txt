USAGE
	[TABLE_ALIAS] [[FILTERS]] [[OPTIONS]]

INPUT DATA TYPES
	RANGE
		An integer range is of the form [MIN]-[MAX]
		MIN must be a non-negative integer
		MAX must be either a non-negative integer, or "?" (without the quotation marks)
	
	NAME
		A string surrounded by double quotes, with all double quotes within itself escaped
		EXAMPLES
			"Foo"
			"Bar"
			"Ree Gee"
			"Jeremy \"Stark\" Smith"
			"[.]mp4$"
	
	NAME_LIST
		A list of NAMEs
		If there is just one NAME in the list, it is interpreted as a regexp.
		EXAMPLES
			"English (Language)" "French (Language)"
				A list of two strings that is interpreted as an array of literal strings
			"[^ ]+ \(Language\)$"
				A list of one string that is interpreted as a regexp

FILTERS
Each may be preceded by "not" (without the quotation marks) to invert the filter
Each must be separated by a logical operator - thus far the only implemented ones are "and" and "or" (use without the quotation marks)
	[TABLE_ALIAS] [NAME_LIST]
		Entries have relations to entries of one of these names in this table
		TABLE_ALIAS must be one of:
			t (tag - matching against child tags too)
			t! (tag)
			f (file)
			d (dir)
			d! (dir - matching against only the basename)
			x (for file only - file appears in the named external database)
	D exists
		Only available for file and directory tables.
		Filters for files/dirs that reside on a device that the server can access with an fopen call (i.e. files that are both local and readable)
	value [RANGE] [NAME_LIST]
		Entries have a variable named one of the listed names, which has a value in the specified range
	attr [ATTRIBUTE] [OPERATOR] [STRING_OR_INTEGER]
		A filter that operates directly on the columns of the primary table.
		If it is a string, STRING_OR_INTEGER must be surrounded by double quotes, with any contained double quotes escaped. Else it must be a positive integer
		OPERATOR must be one of
			Integers only: ">", "<"
			Strings only:  "r" (regexp)
			Any:           "="
		SHORTHAND
			A NAME on its own, without even specifying "attr", is interpreted as shorthand for
				attr name r [NAME]
		EXAMPLES
			f attr name r "[Pp]attern"
				Filter for files whose names match the regexp
			f attr id < 99
			f attr size < 1000000
				Search for files under 1MB in size
			f attr dir < 1000
				Note that dir is an integer - it is not translated to a string with this filter
			f "^A"
				Shorthand for
					f attr name r "^A"
				Lists all files beginning with "A"
	backups [RANGE]
		Filter for files with a number of backups in this range
	same [ATTRIBUTE] [RANGE]
		This filter is NOT to be preceded by a logical operator
		Only for the file table
		Filters results for files sharing an attribute, that attribute having a number (in the given range) of files associated with it.
		The order in which this filter is applied matters
			For many-to-one attributes (such as name, dir, mime, size, duration, md5, sha)
				All other filters declared before this filter apply WITH this filter
				All other filters declared after this filter apply AFTER this filter
			For many-to-many attributes (such as dct)
				It is a bit different
		ATTRIBUTE must be one of
			many-to-one options:
				name (WARNING: Might take a VERY long time without other filters)
				dir
				mime
				size
				duration
				md5
				sha
				time_origin
				time_recorded
				width
				height
				fps
				views
				likes
				dislikes
			many-to-many options:
				dct (perceptual DCT hash)
				audio (perceptual audio hash)
				tag
		EXAMPLES
			many-to-one
				f "foo" same dir 2-?
					Finds files matching the regexp "foo", so long as they share a directory with another file matching that regexp.
				f same dir 2-? "foo"
					Finds files matching the regexp "foo", so long as there is another file in its directory
			many-to-many
				f "foo" same dct 2-?
					Finds files whose DCT hashes overlap with those of files with names matching the regexp "foo"
				f same dct 2-? "foo"
					Finds files matching the regexp "foo", so long as there is another file with overlapping DCT hashes
				f same dct 101-?
					List files who have a DCT hash that at least 100 other files also have
				f same dct 1-1
					List files who have a unique DCT hash

OPTIONS
	order [MODE] [ATTRIBUTE]
		MODE must be one of a (ascending) or d (descending)
		Order results by the ATTRIBUTE
		For many-to-many attributes, files with multiple matching attributes will appear multiple times
		ATTRIBUTE must be one of
			many-to-one options:
				name
			one-to-one options:
				id
				size (for tags/dirs, it is the number of files associated with it)
			file table additional options: Any of the attributes listed under the "same" filter
	order-by-value [MODE] [[NAMES]]
		MODE must be one of a (ascending) or d (descending)
		NAMES must be a list of NAMEs (like a NAME_LIST, except a list of length 1 will not be interpreted as a regexp)
		Order results by the named variables, in that order.
		The order is left-to-right, the value being a chain of IFNULLs
	limit [INTEGER]
	offset [INTEGER]

KNOWN BUGS
	At least one filter must be included

EXAMPLES
	f t "Music" t "English (Language)" "French (Language)" "German (Language)" and value 90-100 "Musicness" "Score" and attr name r "[.]webm$" limit 100
		List 100 WEBM files tagged Music and also tagged one of: English, French or German language, having either a musicness or score of between 90 and 100
	f attr name r "\\\\.mp4" and d "^/" limit 100
		List 100 MP4 files on the server
	f d "^https://www[.]youtube[.]com/" order-by-value d "Musicness" "Score"
		List files from https://youtube.com/ in descending order of 'value', where the 'value' is either the file's "Musicness" or - if that is unavailable - the file's "Score"
	f d "^http" and not t "Music"
		List remote (over HTTP/HTTPS) files which are not tagged "Music"
	f not t "!!ROOT TAG||" and not "[.](json|xml)$"
		List files which are not tagged with anything, ignoring JSON and XML files.
	f mime "^image/"
		List files with image mimetypes
	f ( t "Music" and t "Video" ) or ( t "Music" and mime "^video/" )
		List music videos
	f attr name r "[.](png|jpe?g)" same dct 60-? limit 1000
		The command I used to locate all my neural style transfer renders
	f "[.](mp4)" same dct 10-? limit 1000
		Equivalent to
			f attr name r "[.](mp4)" same dct 10-? limit 1000
		The command I used to locate videos by a Youtuber (using the same video intro in his videos)
	f attr name r "[.](mp4|MP4|mkv|MKV|avi|AVI|webm|WEBM)$" same dct 2-? and attr name r "[.](png|jpe?g|PNG|JPE?G|gif|GIF|bmp|BMP)$"
		Find files which are probably screenshots of movies
	f same size 2-? limit 100 order d size
		Find files that are probably duplicates, based only on their file sizes.
	f d "^https://www.youtube.com/watch\?v=" same dct 2-? same size 2-? limit 100
		Find files which have the same DCT hash and same size as a file from youtube.
	d "." order d size
		List the directories with the most files (non-recursive)
	t "." order d size
		List the tags associated with the most files (not counting descendant tags)
