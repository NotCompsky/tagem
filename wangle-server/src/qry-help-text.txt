USAGE
	[TABLE_ALIAS] [[FILTERS]] [[OPTIONS]]

INPUT DATA TYPES
	RANGE
		A numeric range is of the form [MIN]-[MAX]
		MIN must be a number
		MAX must be either a number, or "?" (without the quotation marks)
	
	NAME
		A string surrounded by double quotes, with all double quotes within itself escaped
		EXAMPLES
			"Foo"
			"Bar"
			"Ree Gee"
			"Jeremy \"Stark\" Smith"
			"[.]mp4$"
	
	NAME_LIST
		A list of NAMEs
		If there is just one NAME in the list, it is interpreted as a regexp.
		EXAMPLES
			"English (Language)" "French (Language)"
				A list of two strings that is interpreted as an array of literal strings
			"[^ ]+ \(Language\)$"
				A list of one string that is interpreted as a regexp
	
	TABLE_ALIAS
		file        f
		dir         d
		dir         d! (matching only against the basename)
		device      D
			Only available for one sub-filter - "D exists".
		tag         t  (matching against child tags too)
		tag         t!
		external_db x
			Only available as a sub-filter, for files.
	
	ATTRIBUTE
		Different tables may have different valid attributes.
		Each attribute has a "kind" of relation too - either one-to-many, or many-to-many
		VALID ATTRIBUTES
			[ATTRIBUTE_KIND] attributes

FILTERS
Each may be preceded by "not" (without the quotation marks) to invert the filter
Each must be separated by a logical operator - thus far the only implemented ones are "and" and "or" (use without the quotation marks)
	[TABLE_ALIAS] [NAME_LIST]
		Entries have relations to entries of one of these names in this table
	D exists
		Only available for file and directory tables.
		Filters for files/dirs that reside on a device that the server can access with an fopen call (i.e. files that are both local and readable)
	value [RANGE] [NAME_LIST]
		Entries have a variable named one of the listed names, which has a value in the specified range
	attr [ATTRIBUTE] [OPERATOR] [STRING_OR_INTEGER]
		A filter that operates directly on the columns of the primary table.
		If it is a string, STRING_OR_INTEGER must be surrounded by double quotes, with any contained double quotes escaped. Else it must be a positive integer
		OPERATOR must be one of
			Integers only: ">", "<"
			Strings only:  "r" (regexp)
			Any:           "="
		SHORTHAND
			A NAME on its own, without even specifying "attr", is interpreted as shorthand for
				attr name r [NAME]
		EXAMPLES
			f attr name r "[Pp]attern"
				Filter for files whose names match the regexp
			f attr id < 99
			f attr size < 1000000
				Search for files under 1MB in size
			f attr dir < 1000
				Note that dir is an integer - it is not translated to a string with this filter
			f "^A"
				Shorthand for
					f attr name r "^A"
				Lists all files beginning with "A"
			t attr parent = "Country"
				Filter for tags where one immediate ancestor is the tag "Country"
			t attr parenty = "Continent"
				Filter for tags where any ancestor is the tag "Continent"
			t attr parenty = "British City" and attr parenty = "Terrorist Attack" ?list
				List all terrorist attacks which occurred in British cities
			t attr childy r "Terrorist Attack" and not attr parenty r "Terrorist Attack" and attr parenty = "British City" ?list limit 100
				List all British cities which hosted terrorist attacks
	mime [REGEX]
		Filter for files with a mimetype of the given name.
		Note that, unlike this, "attr mime" refers to the mime's ID, not name.
	backups [RANGE]
		Filter for files with a number of backups in this range
	boxes [RANGE]
		Filter for files with a number of boxes in this range.
	tags [RANGE]
		Filter for files with a number of associated tags in this range.
	same [ATTRIBUTE] [RANGE]
		This filter is NOT to be preceded by a logical operator
		Only for the file table
		Filters results for files sharing an attribute, that attribute having a number (in the given range) of files associated with it.
		The order in which this filter is applied matters
			For many-to-one attributes (such as name, dir, mime, size, duration, md5, sha)
				All other filters declared before this filter apply WITH this filter
				All other filters declared after this filter apply AFTER this filter
			For many-to-many attributes (such as dct)
				It is a bit different
		WARNING
			 Using the name attribute might take a VERY long time to execute without other filters
		EXAMPLES
			many-to-one
				f "foo" same dir 2-?
					Finds files matching the regexp "foo", so long as they share a directory with another file matching that regexp.
				f same dir 2-? "foo"
					Finds files matching the regexp "foo", so long as there is another file in its directory
			many-to-many
				f "foo" same dct 2-?
					Finds files whose DCT hashes overlap with those of files with names matching the regexp "foo"
				f same dct 2-? "foo"
					Finds files matching the regexp "foo", so long as there is another file with overlapping DCT hashes
				f same dct 101-?
					List files who have a DCT hash that at least 100 other files also have
				f same dct 1-1
					List files who have a unique DCT hash

OPTIONS
	order [MODE] [ATTRIBUTE]
		MODE must be one of a (ascending) or d (descending)
		Order results by the ATTRIBUTE
		For many-to-many attributes, files with multiple matching attributes will appear multiple times
		ATTRIBUTE must be one of
			many-to-one options:
				name
			one-to-one options:
				id
				size (for tags/dirs, it is the number of files associated with it)
			file table additional options: Any of the attributes listed under the "same" filter
	order-by-value [MODE] [[NAMES]]
		MODE must be one of a (ascending) or d (descending)
		NAMES must be a list of NAMEs (like a NAME_LIST, except a list of length 1 will not be interpreted as a regexp)
		Order results by the named variables, in that order.
		The order is left-to-right, the value being a chain of IFNULLs
	limit [INTEGER]
	offset [INTEGER]
	?[DATA_FORMAT]
		DATA_FORMAT must be one of
			count
				This leads to a "SELECT COUNT(*)" as the SQL query selection
			list    (only for file table)
				This leads to returning a list of file URLs
			size    (only for file table)
				This returns the total size of all selected files
			views
				This returns the total number of views across all selected files

EXAMPLES
	f order d id limit 1
		List the last added file

	f attr name r "\\\\.mp4" and d "^/" limit 100
		List 100 MP4 files on the server
	f d "^https://www[.]youtube[.]com/" order-by-value d "Musicness" "Score"

		Equivalent to
			f attr name r "[.](mp4)" same dct 10-? limit 1000

	f attr name r "[.](mp4|MP4|mkv|MKV|avi|AVI|webm|WEBM)$" same dct 2-? and attr name r "[.](png|jpe?g|PNG|JPE?G|gif|GIF|bmp|BMP)$"
		Find files which are probably screenshots of movies
	f same size 2-? limit 100 order d size
